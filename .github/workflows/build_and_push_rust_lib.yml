        # In the context of Cargo and crates published on crates.io, there isn't a specific field or mechanism within Cargo.toml or 
        # the Cargo ecosystem that directly corresponds to a "revision number" separate from the SemVer components (Major, Minor, Patch). 
        # The patch number shall be incremented instead on bug fixes, minor changes in the Cargo.toml file

        # Each version should include (See: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html):
        # A changelog entry, preferably manually curated though a generated one is better than nothing
        # A git tag pointing to the published commit
