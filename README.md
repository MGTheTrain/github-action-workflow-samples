## Summary

A collection of Github Action workflow samples. For simplicity and to illustrate the concept, only manual workflow dispatch events will trigger workflows. The demonstration will not include the gitflow workflow with pull request and push request triggers involving dev, release/*, and master branches. Hence, [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/lang/de/) will not be taken into account either.
